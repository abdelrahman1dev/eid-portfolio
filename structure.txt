 Landing Page Layout
1. Side Navigation (Fixed Left/Right)

2. Hero Section

Layout:

Left side → Text (Dad’s name, 17+ years exp, short tagline).

Right side → Profile picture (circle with subtle border glow).

Background:

 or Framer Motion.

Gradient overlay for depth.

Animation:

Fade-in text & image.

Floating effect for pfp (Framer Motion y oscillation).

3. Quick Highlights (Brands Worked With)

Elegant grid of client logos.

Monochrome logos → hover turns them full color (clean effect).

Section title: “Trusted by leading brands”.

4. Storytelling Timeline (17+ Years)

Animated horizontal/vertical timeline.

Each milestone (year range) → company/project highlight.

Use Framer Motion scroll-triggered reveal.

2013–2017: Motion Lead @ ABC Agency

2018–Now: Freelance Motion Specialist

5. Small Projects Gallery

Mini grid (3–6 items) previewing selected works.

Social icons (Behance, LinkedIn, Dribbble, Email).
